A compilation of things that were tried in the “rheat” app, with
details on what worked and didn’t work.

Issues
~~~~~~

The following things were tried and there were problems:

- Filters:

  * Some actions can cause long pauses without any hints.

  * "Energy Filter": Improve error for min-not-less-than-max.

  * "Complex Distance Filter": Out-of-bounds exception when used.

- "Display Window":

  * Helices are sometimes hard to select, even when zoomed.

- "Control Window":

  * Occasionally the "Current Helices", "Total Helices" and
    "Actual Helices" fields appear to be enabled for typing but
    I think they are meant to always be disabled/view-only.

- "Filter History":

  * The Undo feature fails on Windows (file issue?).

- Help:

  * Display of HTML does not work on Windows (file issue?).

- General:

  * There are display glitches in Flat View, and when zooming
    the 2D view to certain levels.

  * UI could be tweaked to leave more space for things and have
    more ways to resize, etc.



Now Fixed
~~~~~~~~~

The following items are now FIXED (moved from list above):

- Menus:

  * "Open" will only recognize files with .bpseq extension.

  * Selecting any filter may display an error about Undo files,
    EVERY time a filter is selected.  (Remove this.)

  * Seems to have trouble opening multiple files in a session
    (e.g. sometimes a file will not load unless rheat.jar is
    quit and rerun).

- Filters:

  * Undoing a filter in the list will remove all those below.

- "Display Window":

  * Dr. Gutell sees no helices when using Windows.
    UPDATE: Seems that after applying a Base Filter, and using
    buttons like "Flat View" and back to "2D View", helices may
    appear.  This could be a display-updating bug.

- "Control Window":

  * Clipped on Mac; cannot be resized or scrolled, cannot see the
    "Actual Helices" field as a result.

  * Zoom level 1.5 does not seem to do anything different than 1.

  * Seems like zoom 10 is useful but zoom 100 is too much; may
    want to add a zoom level 15 or 20, say.

  * Zoom level 100 runs out of memory.

  * Zoom levels as low as 5 or 10 can also run out of memory if
    the file that was loaded is quite large (e.g. 2000 helices).

- "Filter History":

  * Clicking "Undo" may display an error about saving data.

- Source Code:

  * Several Java warnings when compiling (should clean up, they
    may indicate possible bugs in the code).



Working
~~~~~~~

The following things were tried and they DO seem to work:

- Menus:

  * On Mac, tried all 4 .bpseq files in "rheat/test/*.bpseq".
    Also, I can get them working on a Windows 7 laptop.  Jamie
    can open files on Linux and Windows servers.

  * Have successfully opened files with at least 2904 helices.

  * Preferences seem to work properly if they are set to a valid
    pair of directories.

- Filters:

  * "Basepair Filter" was tried, checking types on/off.

  * "Helix Filter" was tried, seems to apply correctly.

  * "Diagonal Filter" was tried, seems to apply correctly.

  * "AA / AG Ends" was tried, seems to apply correctly.

  * "E-Loop" was tried, seems to apply correctly.

  * "Energy Filter" was tried, seems to apply correctly if given
    valid input.

- "Display Window":

  * Clicking will show x, y in "Helix Info" and, if a helix is
    selected, more information on 5', 3', etc.

- "Control Window":

  * "Flat View" button changes "Display Window" view.

  * "2D View" button restores helix chart.

- Source Code:

  * I can build the program on my Mac (JDK SE 1.7.0_75).

  * Jamie can build it on Linux.
