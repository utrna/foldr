  <h1>RNA HEAT: Menus</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="File">File</h2>
  <p><b>Open RNA File</b>:
  Updates the display with the contents of an RNA data source (such
  as a '.bpseq' file).  If the option to overlay is not chosen then
  any previously-opened file is closed.  If an overlay is requested
  then the new RNA appears on top of the previous one, in a
  different color.
  <p><b>Open Annotation File</b>:
  Updates the display using a source of helix annotations (such as
  a '.helixcolor' file).  The annotations should refer to the same
  nucleotide numbers as the currently-loaded RNA, or the matching
  helices will not be highlighted.  Note that Preferences can be
  used to customize annotation colors.
  <p><b>Open Text or Image File</b>:
  Opens a data file in a separate display, keeping the RNA display
  untouched.  For example, this can be used to display results from
  other programs (such as logs, statistics or graphs).
  <p><b>Run Script</b>:
  Runs commands from a JavaScript ('.js') file, such as a series of
  constraints.  Currently, such scripts must make use of a variable
  named "rheat".  See <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a> for
  more information.
  <p><b>Scripting Console</b>:
  Shows a window for running scripting commands interactively, and
  displaying history.  See <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a>
  for more information.
  <p><b>Run Program</b>:
  Runs external programs, sending output to the current experiment
  tree.  See <a href="programs.html">programs</a> for more
  information.
  <p><b>Close Window</b>:
  Hides the frontmost window that has a close box.  Note that most
  RNA HEAT windows will always be visible but this can be used to
  discard other windows (such as this help page).
  <p><b>Close RNA</b>:
  Clears the display and all other windows.  Note that if you open
  a new file, any previously-displayed file is closed implicitly.
  <p><b>Save As</b>:
  Exports a picture of the current display as an image file (such
  as '.png').  The image file will reflect what is displayed,
  including constraints or selections.  Note that if the display
  has been zoomed, the image file will be much larger.
  <p><b>Exit</b> (or <b>Quit</b>):
  Ends the program.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Edit">Edit</h2>
  <p><b>Undo</b>:
  Reverses the effects of the most recent action, if possible.  A
  series of Undo commands is possible, as each previous state is
  saved as a separate file (see Preferences).
  <p><b>Cut</b>:
  Clears any selection, if possible, and copies it to the Clipboard.
  The Paste command may then be used.
  <p><b>Copy</b>:
  Copies any selection to the Clipboard, if possible.  The Paste
  command may then be used.
  <p><b>Paste</b>:
  Inserts anything that has been put on the Clipboard with a Copy
  command.
  <p><b>Preferences</b>:
  Allows customization of behavior, such as the directory to start
  from when opening files.  These settings are saved as scripting
  commands in your home folder, under '.rheat/prefs.js'.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Constraints">Constraints</h2>
  <p><b>Basepairs</b>:
  Excludes helices that do not match selected base-pair values,
  such as 'C-G'.  If another RNA overlay is being shown, this
  applies to both (unlike other constraints).
  <p><b>Helix Length</b>:
  Excludes helices with a span more or less than the specified
  range.  One of the values may be omitted to include everything in
  that direction (for instance, omitting the upper value will show
  helices greater than or equal to the minimum length).
  <p><b>Diagonal Distance</b>:
  Excludes helices whose distance from the diagonal line (2D view)
  is outside the given range.  One of the values may be omitted to
  include everything in that direction (for instance, omitting the
  upper value will show helices that are at least as far from the
  diagonal as the minimum distance).
  <p><b>AA / AG Ends</b>:
  Excludes helices that do not have AA or AG “just past” their
  ends.
  <p><b>E-Loop</b>:
  Excludes helices unless they have AAG at 3' start, AUG at 5'
  start, GAA at 3' end, and AUG at 5' end.
  <p><b>Helix Energy</b>:
  Excludes helices that have an energy value outside the given
  range.  One of the values may be omitted to include everything in
  that direction (for instance, omitting the upper value will show
  helices with energy values greater than or equal to the minimum
  value).  Note that this constraint overrides the color spectrum
  feature, redefining the spectrum (if shown) as the range of
  energy values in the constraint; therefore, if you have a script
  that wants to define a different spectrum, the custom definition
  must be set up <i>after</i> any energy constraints.
  <p><b>Complex Distance</b>:
  Excludes helices with simple or complex distances that are
  greater than the specified maximums.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="View">View</h2>
  <p><b>2D</b>:
  Changes to a two-axis display mode, with a diagonal line.
  <p><b>Flat</b>:
  Changes to a single-axis display mode.
  <p><b>Zoom Out</b>:
  Shows more of the display, at a reduced size.
  <p><b>Zoom In</b>:
  Shows less of the display, at an increased size.
  <p><b>Zoom to Fit</b>:
  Shows the entire display, at a size that fills the window.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Window">Window</h2>
  <p><b>Minimize Window</b>:
  Reduces the frontmost window to a miniature form.  Equivalent to
  clicking the minimization button on the window frame.
  <p><b>Zoom Window</b> (or <b>Maximize/Restore Window</b>):
  Toggles the frontmost window between its two main sizes.
  Equivalent to clicking the maximizing button on the window frame.
  <p><b>Select Next Window</b>:
  Brings another window to the front.
  <p><b>Select Previous Window</b>:
  Brings another window to the front (reverse order).
  <p><b>(names of windows)</b>:
  A list of open windows, such as opened documents and the help
  window, will appear at the end of this menu.  Select an item to
  bring that window to the front.
  <p>

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Help">Help</h2>
  <p><b>Contents</b>:
  Displays this help window.
  <p><b>Go Back</b>:
  Displays the previously-visited help page, if a link was followed.
  <p><b>About</b>:
  Shows a window with information on the authors of RNA HEAT.
