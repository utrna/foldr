  <h1>RNA HEAT: Menus</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="File">File</h2>
  <p><b>Open RNA File</b>:
  Updates the display with the contents of an RNA data source (such
  as a '.bpseq' file).  If the option to overlay is not chosen then
  any previously-opened file is closed.  If an overlay is requested
  then the new RNA appears on top of the previous one, in a
  different color.
  <p><b>Open Data File</b>:
  Opens a data file in a separate display, keeping the RNA display
  untouched.  This can be used to show plain text files, for
  example.
  <p><b>Run Script</b>:
  Runs commands from a JavaScript ('.js') file, such as a series of
  filters.  Currently, such scripts must make use of a variable
  named "rheat".  See <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a> for
  more information.
  <p><b>Run Program</b>:
  Runs external programs, sending output to the current experiment
  tree.  Use Preferences to specify the top of the tree.  The
  output of the program appears in a "log.txt" file in the current
  experiment directory.
  <p><b>Close Window</b>:
  Hides the frontmost window that has a close box.  Note that most
  RNA HEAT windows will always be visible but this can be used to
  discard other windows (such as this help page).
  <p><b>Close RNA</b>:
  Clears the display and all other windows.  Note that if you open
  a new file, any previously-displayed file is closed implicitly.
  <p><b>Save As</b>:
  Exports a picture of the current display as an image file (such
  as '.png').  The image file will reflect what is displayed,
  including any filters or selections.  Note that if the display
  has been zoomed, the image file will be much larger.
  <p><b>Exit</b> (or <b>Quit</b>):
  Ends the program.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Edit">Edit</h2>
  <p><b>Undo</b>:
  Reverses the effects of the most recent action, if possible.  A
  series of Undo commands is possible, as each previous state is
  saved as a separate file (see Preferences).
  <p><b>Preferences</b>:
  Allows customization of behavior, such as the directory to start
  from when opening files.  These settings are saved as scripting
  commands in your home folder, under ".rheat/prefs.js".

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Filters">Filters</h2>
  <p><b>Basepair Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices that do not match selected base-pair values,
  such as 'C-G'.  If another RNA overlay is being shown, the filter
  applies to both (unlike other filters).
  <p><b>Helix Length Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices with a span more or less than the specified
  range.  One of the values may be omitted to include everything in
  that direction (for instance, omitting the upper value will show
  helices greater than or equal to the minimum length).
  <p><b>Diagonal Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices whose distance from the diagonal line (2D view)
  is outside the given range.  One of the values may be omitted to
  include everything in that direction (for instance, omitting the
  upper value will show helices that are at least as far from the
  diagonal as the minimum distance).
  <p><b>AA / AG Ends Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices that do not have AA or AG “just past” their
  ends.
  <p><b>E-Loop Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices unless they have AAG at 3' start, AUG at 5'
  start, GAA at 3' end, and AUG at 5' end.
  <p><b>Energy Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices that have an energy value outside the given
  range.  One of the values may be omitted to include everything in
  that direction (for instance, omitting the upper value will show
  helices with energy values greater than or equal to the minimum
  value).
  <p><b>Complex Distance Filter</b>:
  Excludes helices with simple or complex distances that are
  greater than the specified maximums.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="View">View</h2>
  <p><b>2D</b>:
  Changes to a two-axis display mode, with a diagonal line.
  <p><b>Flat</b>:
  Changes to a single-axis display mode.
  <p><b>Zoom Out</b>:
  Shows more of the display, at a reduced size.
  <p><b>Zoom In</b>:
  Shows less of the display, at an increased size.
  <p><b>Zoom to Fit</b>:
  Shows the entire display, at a size that fills the window.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Window">Window</h2>
  <p><b>Minimize Window</b>:
  Reduces the frontmost window to a miniature form.  Equivalent to
  clicking the minimization button on the window frame.
  <p><b>Zoom Window</b> (or <b>Maximize/Restore Window</b>):
  Toggles the frontmost window between its two main sizes.
  Equivalent to clicking the maximizing button on the window frame.
  <p><b>Select Next Window</b>:
  Brings another window to the front.
  <p><b>Select Previous Window</b>:
  Brings another window to the front (reverse order).
  <p><b>Display Window</b>:
  Brings the Display Window to the front.  For more information,
  see <a href="windows.html">the windows page</a>.
  <p><b>Controls</b>:
  Brings the Controls to the front.  For more information, see <a
  href="windows.html">the windows page</a>.
  <p><b>Filter History</b>:
  Brings the Filter History to the front.  For more information,
  see <a href="windows.html">the windows page</a>.
  <p><b>Helix Info</b>:
  Brings the Helix Info to the front.  For more information, see
  <a href="windows.html">the windows page</a>.

  <h2 id="Help">Help</h2>
  <p><b>Contents</b>:
  Displays this help window.
  <p><b>Go Back</b>:
  Displays the previously-visited help page, if a link was followed.
  <p><b>About</b>:
  Shows a window with information on the authors of RNA HEAT.
