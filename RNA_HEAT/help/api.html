  <h1>RNA HEAT: Scripting: API Reference</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Common Function Argument Rules</h2>

  <p>Any <b>file arguments</b> may either use absolute pathnames for
  the current platform (such as Windows or Mac or Linux), or they may
  be file names that are expected to match something in the current
  working directory (see setWorkingDir() below).

  <p>Any <b>color arguments</b> are quoted strings that use the HTML
  hash-RGB convention; for example, '#ff0000' is a bright red, and
  '#cccccc' is a medium gray.  The Scripting Console, Preferences
  dialog and other graphical interfaces provide convenient color
  editors to make it easier to compose these color strings.

  <p>If a function returns an <b>iterator</b>, multiple results can be
  retrieved as described under "Iterator Object Functions" below.

  <p>If a function returns a <b>helix</b>, properties of the helix can
  be retrieved as described under "Helix Object Functions" below.

  <br /><br />
  <h2>"rheat" Functions</h2>
  <p>The majority of scripting functions in RNA HEAT are accessed
  through a variable named "rheat".  (This distinguishes them from
  functions in the JavaScript language that are outside RNA HEAT.)

  <dl>
  <dt>RNA Management Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>openRNA(file)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a ".bpseq" file, closing any currently-displayed RNA
    automatically (as if closeRNA() had been used).</dd>
    <dt>openOverlayRNA(file, color)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a ".bpseq" file WITHOUT closing any currently-displayed
    RNA; and to keep the new helices distinct, they use the specified
    color instead of the default color.  The overlay should ideally
    have the same base-pair length as the currently-displayed RNA,
    representing a compatible sequence.  Note that overlays can cause
    performance problems for large data sets, and annotation (tags)
    may be a better solution.</dd>
    <dt>openTags(file)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a ".helixcolor" file with annotations to apply to the
    currently-displayed RNA.  The 5' and 3' ranges in the annotations
    will either match existing helices, or cause new helices to be
    created.</dd>
    <dt>setBasePairs(bp1[, bp2][, ...])</dt>
    <dd>After loading an RNA file, base-pairs must be specified so that
    helices can be identified.  This function accepts as many values as
    necessary; each value should be a quoted string containing exactly
    two characters identifying a valid type of base-pair such as 'CG',
    'AU' or 'GU'.  In the graphical interface, this type of command can
    also be generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>closeRNA()</dt>
    <dd>Closes any current RNA file, clearing the display.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Program-Running Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>runScript(file)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a ".js" file or other RNA HEAT script in text format,
    running it completely before exiting from the runScript() function
    (this allows you to share common functionality between scripts).</dd>
    <dt>runProgram(file)</dt>
    <dd>Opens a program in ".py" or ".jar" format, running it completely
    before exiting from the runProgram() function.  The program runs in
    the current experiment tree, set in Preferences, in the date-stamped
    subdirectory created at the time that RNA HEAT was run.  If you need
    to force the program into a new experiment area, call newExperiment()
    (see below).  Prior to running the program, per the protocol, any
    current RNA will be copied to the experiment area as "input.bpseq";
    and, after the program ends, any results such as "output.txt" and
    "output.png" will be displayed, any "output.helixcolor" will be
    automatically annotated, and any "output.bpseq" will automatically be
    opened as an overlay.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Logging Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>log(level, text)</dt>
    <dd>Writes a message to the terminal with the specified level, which
    can be "rheat.INFO", "rheat.WARN" or "rheat.ERROR".  In addition, if
    the Log window of the graphical interface is showing, the message
    will be displayed at the end of the log.  Currently, the level affects
    the line prefix and the color of each log message.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dl>
  <dt>Constraint Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>addAAandAGFilter()</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>addComplexFilter(complex, simple)</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>addDiagonalDistanceFilter(maximum, minimum)</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>addELoopFilter()</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>addEnergyFilter(maximum, minimum)</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>addHelixLengthFilter(maximum, minimum)</dt>
    <dd>In the graphical interface, this type of command can be
    configured and generated from the Constraints menu.</dd>
    <dt>removeFilters()</dt>
    <dd>Clears all constraints from the RNA.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Helix-Finding Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>eachActualHelix() &rarr; iterator over helices</dt>
    <dd>Allows access to every helix above the diagonal.</dd>
    <dt>eachPredictedHelix() &rarr; iterator over helices</dt>
    <dd>Allows access to every helix below the diagonal.</dd>
    <dt>getSelectedHelix() &rarr; helix</dt>
    <dd>If a helix has been selected in the graphical interface, this
    returns the selected helix object.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Graphical Interface Manipulation Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>msDelay(milliseconds)</dt>
    <dd>Pauses the script for at least the specified number of
    milliseconds; for example, 1000 is one second.  This can be
    used to perform basic animations; see the annotation functions.</dd>
    <dt>scrollTo(x, y)</dt>
    <dd>Moves the graphical RNA display so that the center is on
    the given location.  The X and Y values should be between 1
    and the number of base-pairs in the sequence.</dd>
    <dt>zoomTo(level)</dt>
    <dd>Changes the graphical zoom level to the specified level
    of magnification, such as 1.5 for 1.5-times (the limits are
    the same as in the graphical slider so the maximum is 20.0
    and the minimum is 0.01).</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Annotation Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>hideHelixTag(tag)</dt>
    <dd>An alias for hideHelixTags().</dd>
    <dt>hideHelixTags(tag1[, tag2][, ...])</dt>
    <dd>Makes the given tags invisible, which could change the appearance
    of helices (if the now-invisible tags have higher priorities than
    other tags on those helices).  See also showHelixTags().</dd>
    <dt>setHelixSpectrum(tag, maximum, minimum)</dt>
    <dd>Specifies that any helices with the given tag should be
    colored according to the spectrum given.  The maximum and
    minimum values determine which numeric values for tags are in
    range (anything outside is not given a spectrum color).  This
    is the same spectrum used by energy constraints so setting a
    new energy constraint will override these settings.</dd>
    <dt>setHelixTagColor(tag, color)</dt>
    <dd>Specifies that a helix with the given tag could be drawn
    in the given color.  Since helices can have more than one tag,
    the color that is used depends on visibility settings and tag
    priorities.  Currently, tags are implicitly prioritized based
    on the order in which setHelixTagColor() or setHelixTagLineWidth()
    are used for one tag, relative to the other tags.</dd>
    <dt>setHelixTagLineWidth(tag, width)</dt>
    <dd>Specifies that a helix with the given tag could be drawn
    with the given line width.  The same caveats apply here, as for
    setHelixTagColor().</dd>
    <dt>showHelixTag(tag)</dt>
    <dd>An alias for showHelixTags().</dd>
    <dt>showHelixTags(tag1[, tag2][, ...])</dt>
    <dd>Makes the given tags visible, which could change the appearance
    of helices (if the now-visible tags have higher priorities than
    previously-visible tags on those helices).  See also hideHelixTags().</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Directory Path Management Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>getWorkingDir() &rarr; pathname</dt>
    <dd>Returns the absolute location of the current working
    directory, which determines where a file is found if it is
    specified only by name.  By default, this will be the
    directory that contains the current script file (though for
    Scripting Console commands, this may need to be specific).</dd>
    <dt>makePath(element1[, element2][, ...]) &rarr; pathname</dt>
    <dd>Given a series of path elements (directory names and possibly
    an ending file name), returns the platform-specific path (using
    backslashes on Windows and forward slashes otherwise).  This can
    be helpful for writing portable scripts.</dd>
    <dt>setWorkingDir(directory)</dt>
    <dd>Changes the current directory, after which files given
    only by name will be assumed to come from that directory.  This
    also creates a stack of previous values, that can be returned to
    (in reverse order, automatically) with setWorkingDirToPrevious().</dd>
    <dt>setWorkingDirToPrevious()</dt>
    <dd>Returns to whichever directory was current before the most
    recent call to setWorkingDir().  This can be useful for writing
    scripts that change the directory in order to perform some
    temporary action, and then restore it afterward.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Preference Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>setPreference(name, value)</dt>
    <dd><i>Permanently</i> changes the specified preference (in that
    these values are saved to your preferences file when RNA HEAT quits,
    and restored on the next run).  <b>Direct use of this function by
    scripts is not recommended</b>; see setTemporaryPreference().</dd>
    <dt>setTemporaryPreference(name, value)</dt>
    <dd>In scripts, this is the <b>recommended way</b> to temporarily
    change settings that are ordinarily set using the Preferences
    dialog.  This <i>completely overrides</i> the specified preference
    for the duration of the script but <i>does not save</i> the change
    to your own preferences file.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Iterator Object Functions</h2>
  <p>Some functions are called directly on Iterator objects; Iterator
  objects by convention are returned by functions whose names start with
  the word "each", documented earlier.

  <dl>
  <dt>Iterator Functions</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>left() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the number of items left, which will be zero if the
    iteration is complete.</dd>
    <dt>length() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the number of items that will be iterated over.  NOTE
    that the efficiency of this request is not guaranteed; it may imply
    an internal loop over all values to find the total.  It is best to
    iterate only over values, and count as you go if necessary; do not
    request a count up front unless you have no other reason to loop
    over the iterator.</dd>
    <dt>next() &rarr; value</dt>
    <dd>Returns the next value (moving the iterator forward) or null to
    indicate nothing is left.  This is typically called in a loop.  The
    exact type of value depends on the iteration (for example, it may be
    a Helix or it may be the name of an annotation tag).</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Helix Object Functions</h2>
  <p>Some functions are called directly on Helix objects; Helix
  objects are returned by certain "rheat" functions that were
  documented earlier, such as iterators.

  <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Functions that <i>change</i> properties on a
  Helix object (currently: addTag() and removeTag()) WILL NOT cause the
  display to be redrawn immediately!  The Helix object does not have
  enough information to trigger updates.  Instead, if you need to see an
  immediate change, you must cause the main display to be updated by
  calling some other function on the "rheat" variable (such as the
  rheat.showHelixTag() function).  This turns out to be most efficient
  anyway; for example, if you decide to write a loop to remove tags from
  several helices, it is really best to update the display once at the
  end of the loop.

  <dl>
  <dt>Helix Functions: General</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>energy() &rarr; floating-point number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the helix energy value, which comes from the energy
    calculations of an energy constraint.</dd>
    <dt>length() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the length of the helix, in base-pairs.</dd>
    <dt>fivePrimeEnd() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the location of the end of the 5' sequence.  The number
    is in the range from 1 to the number of base-pairs in the sequence.</dd>
    <dt>fivePrimeSequence() &rarr; nucleotide string</dt>
    <dd>Returns a string containing some combination of the letters A, C,
    G and U, with the nucleotide sequence on the 5' side.</dd>
    <dt>fivePrimeStart() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the location of the start of the 5' sequence.  The number
    is in the range from 1 to the number of base-pairs in the sequence.</dd>
    <dt>threePrimeEnd() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the location of the end of the 3' sequence.  The number
    is in the range from 1 to the number of base-pairs in the sequence.</dd>
    <dt>threePrimeSequence() &rarr; nucleotide string</dt>
    <dd>Returns a string containing some combination of the letters A, C,
    G and U, with the nucleotide sequence on the 3' side.</dd>
    <dt>threePrimeStart() &rarr; number</dt>
    <dd>Returns the location of the start of the 3' sequence.  The number
    is in the range from 1 to the number of base-pairs in the sequence.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  </dl>

  <dl>
  <dt>Helix Functions: Annotation</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>addTag(name)</dt>
    <dd>Adds the specified tag name to the tags on the helix.  This
    is equivalent to annotating the helix using a ".helixcolor" file.</dd>
    <dt>addTag(name, value)</dt>
    <dd>Adds the specified tag name to the tags on the helix, mapped to
    the given value.  This is equivalent to annotating the helix using a
    ".helixcolor" file, through the "name=value" syntax.</dd>
    <dt>eachTag() &rarr; iterator over names</dt>
    <dd>Returns an object that follows the iteration protocol, allowing
    you to see the name of each annotation on the helix in turn.</dd>
    <dt>getTagValue(name) &rarr; string</dt>
    <dd>Returns the value of the specified annotation (tag).  This only
    makes sense for tags that have values.  The hasTag() method can be
    used to see if a tag is defined at all.</dd>
    <dt>hasTag(name) &rarr; true or false</dt>
    <dd>Returns true only if the specified annotation (tag) is present on
    the helix.</dd>
    <dt>removeTag(name)</dt>
    <dd>Deletes the specified annotation (tag) if present on the helix.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
