  <h1>RNA HEAT: Main Window Panels</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Display">Display</h2>
  <p>The display shows the helices of the current RNA, after applying
  any constraints or control settings.  The display may be clicked
  with the mouse to show coordinates and select a helix.  The zoom
  controls may be used as short-cuts for commands in the View menu.
  The jump fields can be used to scroll the display to a particular
  position, using a base-pair number (for example, if the RNA sequence
  has 2900 base-pairs, entering "1450" and clicking Go will jump to
  the center of the display).  If X or Y are omitted when clicking Go,
  the values are assumed to be the same.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="ViewFrame">View Frame</h2>
  <p>This miniature window appears only when some part of the display
  is not visible due to zooming and/or scrolling.  Its white rectangle
  shows which part of the entire RNA is currently visible.  The frame
  may be moved to another location by dragging its title bar.

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="Show">Show</h2>
  <p>The panel of check-boxes on the right-hand side allows you to decide
  which elements of the RNA display are visible.  (It is important to
  note that <a href="scripting.html">scripting commands</a> can show and
  hide elements with more precision than the check-boxes allow.)
  <p><b>Grid</b>:
  Refers to the horizontal and vertical lines and labels that appear in
  the background.
  <p><b>Spectrum</b>:
  Refers to the process of coloring helices based on whichever “bin” they
  have been assigned to.  Bins currently are set only for energy values,
  when a Helix Energy constraint has been applied.  The colors in the
  gradient can be set via Preferences.
  <p><b>Annotations</b>:
  Refers to the set of custom colors and line styles for annotated (tagged)
  helices.  If you want all helices to be drawn normally without showing
  their annotations, uncheck this box (note that it is always possible to
  select a helix to see if it has any annotations).  Tags can be set by a
  ".helixcolor" file (see the “Open Annotation File…” command in the File
  menu), by applying a constraint, or by using scripting commands.
  <p><b>Untagged Helices</b>:
  Completely hides helices that have no annotations.  This helps to reduce
  clutter and improve the performance of the RNA display.  You can use
  this to treat constraints like filters, for instance.
  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="RNAFileInfo">RNA File Info</h2>
  <p>The top-left region shows a summary of the RNA file that is open.
  The Current count depends on any applied Constraints, the Total count
  reflects only the last Base-Pair Filter and the Actual count refers
  to the helices from the original input file (the “correct” helices
  shown in the top-right triangle of the display).

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="SelectedHelix">Selected Helix</h2>
  <p>When you click a helix line, this area shows more information
  about the helix (such as its start and end points, base-pairs, and
  energy).  Two helices that appear mirrored on the diagonal of the 2D
  display often have similar or identical information when selected
  (for example, the helix length may vary between the two).

  <br /><br />
  <h2 id="ConstraintHistory">Constraint History</h2>
  <p>The JavaScript commands that are equivalent to constraint
  actions that have been performed.  For reuse, these commands can
  be copied into a script.  They are also automatically saved to a
  script (in your home folder, under ".rheat/constraints.js").  If you
  click “Undo Last” or use the Undo command, the last constraint
  command in the list is removed and the display rolls back to its
  previous state.
