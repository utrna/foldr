  <h1>RNA HEAT: Scripting</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>General</h2>
  <p>Script files in RNA HEAT use the JavaScript language.  They
  all implicitly have access to a variable named "<tt>rheat</tt>",
  and all calls to the scripting interface must use this variable
  (as shown in the examples that follow).

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Scripting Console</h2>
  <p>The Scripting Console (displayed by the “Scripting Console” command
  in the File menu) can be used to interactively run commands, and to
  Copy and Paste your commands into a script file.

  <p>In addition, the contents of the console history are automatically
  saved in your home folder, under ".rheat/history.js".

  <p>To run new commands, type them into the field at the bottom of
  the Scripting window (next to the “Run” button), using more than
  one line if appropriate.  Click “Run” when finished.  If the
  command is successful, it will be transferred to the top part of
  the window, as command history; otherwise, an error message will
  be displayed.

  <p>If you run any commands that refer to files by name only, their
  locations will be relative to the current working directory (shown at
  the bottom of the window for your convenience).  To change the working
  directory from a script, use "rheat.setWorkingDir()"; for example, if
  the current directory is "/a/b/c" and on Unix you use a path like
  "rheat.setWorkingDir('../d')", the new directory will become "/a/b/d"
  (assuming it exists).  Note that all file-related commands obey the
  platform convention, such as Unix/Mac or Windows; and on Windows, a
  backslash is doubled as in C (e.g. "\\" is one backslash).  For more
  portability, consider using the "rheat.makePath()" function to compose
  paths from a list of components; this adds the correct slashes for you.

  <p>The buttons at the top of the window can be used to perform
  actions on the history display.  To rerun some of the commands in
  history, select the desired lines and click “Run Selected”.  To
  insert comments in history to help separate unrelated tasks, use
  the buttons “Add Divider” and “Add Timestamp”.  To erase the
  entire history display, use “Clear…” (a confirmation warning is
  presented).

  <p>Note that you can resize the window and you can move the bar
  that separates the top and bottom sections, to make more space.
  You can also use the window frame controls to minimize the window
  or close it; it can always be reopened from the menus.

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Examples of Scripting Commands</h2>

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Opening Files</h3>
  <pre>
  rheat.openRNA('test.bpseq')
  rheat.openOverlayRNA('other.bpseq', '#ff0000')
  rheat.openTags('test.helixcolor')</pre>
  <p>The current target file can be set using openRNA().  If the
  current RNA should <i>not</i> be replaced by opening a file, you
  can decide to add results on top.  With openOverlayRNA(), you
  can read additional RNA files (such as a ".bpseq"), displaying
  new helices in the given color.  The new helices are found by
  automatically applying the same series of constraints as the
  1st RNA.  Alternatively, openTags() can be used to read the
  simpler ".helixcolor" annotation format; see below.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Annotating the Display</h3>
  <pre>
  rheat.setHelixTagColor('PI', '#ff0000')
  rheat.setHelixTagColor('PE', '#222222')
  rheat.openTags('test.helixcolor')</pre>
  <p>If openTags() is used (above) to read helix annotations, any
  number of new tags may be created and assigned to helices.  To
  control the presentation of tagged helices, colors may be set for
  specific tags.  In addition, a priority order is implicitly set
  based on which tags are first used with setHelixTagColor(): the
  earlier assignments have higher precedence in case of conflict.
  <p>It is also possible to show or hide arbitrary tags.  Helices
  that have no visible tags will appear like normal helices.
  Otherwise, a helix will appear in the color of one of its tags
  (the highest-priority tag that is not hidden).  Helices will
  change color as soon as a tag is hidden or shown.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Display Controls and Animation</h3>
  <pre>
  var delay = 160
  rheat.scrollTo(270, 270)
  rheat.hideHelixTags('PE', 'PI', 'PET')
  rheat.showHelixTag('PI')
  rheat.msDelay(delay)
  rheat.showHelixTag('PET')</pre>
  <p>The scrollTo() method can be used to move the display to a
  particular X and Y location, where X and Y are bounded by the
  number of base-pairs in the current RNA sequence.  This can be
  used before animation to ensure the desired region is showing.
  <p>The msDelay() routine can be used to force a script to wait for
  the specified number of milliseconds.  If this is done in between
  steps that affect the display, animations can be created.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Running Other Scripts</h3>
  <pre>
  rheat.runScript('script.js')</pre>
  <p>A script can itself run scripts, which is useful when you want
  common steps to be written once and used in multiple places.  The
  search path is temporarily changed to the same location as the
  specified script so you only need to give file names (or relative
  paths) if the target input file is near the script itself.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Experiments</h3>
  <pre>
  rheat.openRNA('test.bpseq')
  status = rheat.runProgram('prog1.py', 'arg1', 'arg2')
  status = rheat.runProgram('prog2.py', 'argument')
  rheat.newExperiment()
  status = rheat.runProgram('prog3.py')</pre>
  <p>Preferences can be used to set the location of the experiment
  tree and the first search location for programs.  Programs run in
  the current experiment, via runProgram().  If a file has been
  loaded into the display view, it is copied into the experiment
  area as "input" with the same extension (e.g. "input.bpseq"),
  allowing programs to easily find input data.  All output from the
  program is captured in a "log.txt" file.  The current experiment
  subdirectory is automatically chosen by date and time for the
  first experiment of a session; if you want to put results in a
  new subdirectory, call newExperiment().

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Logging</h3>
  <pre>
  rheat.log(rheat.INFO, 'This is information.')
  rheat.log(rheat.WARN, 'This is a warning.')
  rheat.log(rheat.ERROR, 'This is an error.')</pre>
  <p>Although it is technically possible to have JavaScript import
  various Java libraries for printing, RNA HEAT has a few simple
  methods available for basic logging of text, as shown below.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Constraints</h3>
  <pre></pre>
  <p>A good way to write constraints in scripts is to start from
  the GUI: load a file, apply some constraints and then inspect
  the Constraint History panel to see the scripting commands. 
  Once you have the commands, you can combine them with others to
  perform full automation (for instance, using "rheat.openRNA()"
  to open a particular file, and then run constraint commands).

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Iteration</h3>
  <pre>
  for (i = 0; i &lt; actual_helices.length(); ++i) {
    helix = actual_helices.next()
    ...
  }</pre>
  <p>Some functions return objects that can iterate over more than
  one other value.  This iteration can be performed as in the above
  example, by looping up to the length() and calling next().  An
  iteration object also has a left() method if you want to see how
  many items remain.
  <p>This approach is taken for efficiency so that memory is not
  allocated unnecessarily.

  <br /><br />
  <h3>Helices</h3>
  <pre>
  actual_helices = rheat.eachActualHelix()
  for (i = 0; i &lt; actual_helices.length(); ++i) {
    helix = actual_helices.next()
    rheat.log(rheat.INFO, "actual helix #" + i +
              ": len=" + helix.length())
  }

  pred_helices = rheat.eachPredictedHelix()
  for (i = 0; i &lt; pred_helices.length(); ++i) {
    helix = pred_helices.next()
    rheat.log(rheat.INFO, "predicted helix #" + i +
              ": len=" + helix.length())
  }

  var selected = rheat.getSelectedHelix()</pre>
  <p>The call "rheat.eachActualHelix()" returns an iterator (see
  “Iteration” above), over all helices that would be rendered in the
  top-right part of the diagonal line in the display.  The helices in
  the lower-left corner can be found with "rheat.eachPredictedHelix()",
  and this list will change depending on any applied constraints.  And
  finally, any clicked helix can be found with getSelectedHelix().
  <p>In each of these cases, a helix can be further queried.  The
  methods threePrimeStart(), threePrimeEnd() and threePrimeSequence()
  return information about the 3' side; similarly, there are the methods
  fivePrimeStart(), fivePrimeEnd() and fivePrimeSequence() for the 5'
  side.  Annotations can be inspected using eachTag() to perform an
  iteration (see “Iteration” above) or tagsInclude() for simple tests.  
  You can also query length(), and energy() if an energy constraint has
  been applied.

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Linux/Mac and Unix-like Systems</h2>
  <p>Special scripts are available in the source tree to simplify
  script invocation on non-Windows platforms: simply make your
  script file “executable” (e.g. using "chmod +x filename.js"), and
  put a header at the top of the file that looks like this:
  <pre>
  #!/usr/bin/env rna_heat
  // now write your script:
  rheat.openRNA('test.bpseq')
  ...</pre>
  <p>The special "rna_heat" script must be in the search path (the
  Unix "PATH" environment variable); it is currently in the top of
  the source tree ("RNA_HEAT" relative to the "git" top-level).
  Also, an alternate script named "rna_heat_no_gui" can be used as
  a short-cut to suppress the graphical interface from a script. 
  See the test cases located in the source tree for more examples.

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Notes for Maintainers</h2>
  <p>All scripting interfaces supported by the "rheat" variable are
  defined in the source tree under "rheat/script/ScriptMain.java".  
  Interfaces on helices are in "rheat/script/ScriptHelix.java", and
  similarly other source files under "rheat/script/" may implement
  different parts of the interface.
