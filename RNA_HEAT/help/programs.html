  <h1>RNA HEAT: Running Programs</h1>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Using the GUI to Run</h2>
  <p>Select the "Run Program" command in the File menu to run arbitrary
  programs (or see below for information on doing this from a script).

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Program Input</h2>
  <p>Before the program runs, the directory is changed to the current
  experiment tree (the root of which is set by Preferences; a unique
  subdirectory is automatically created first).
  <p>If you have opened an RNA, the file that you used is automatically
  copied to the experiment directory, under the name "input.bpseq" (or
  whichever file extension you used).  This convention allows programs
  to easily guess the name and location of the data, without having to be
  told where the data is.

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Program Output</h2>
  <p>The program output will be in the current experiment tree unless
  the program has been written to dump files somewhere else.
  <p>Anything that the program prints to standard output or standard error
  is captured to a file "log.txt".  This is not opened automatically but
  you can choose to view it manually.
  <p>The program must exit with a status of 0 in order to be considered
  successful (if any other exit occurs, output is ignored).  Upon successful
  exit:
  <ul>
  <li>If the program that you run generates a file named "output.bpseq",
  the data will be automatically displayed as an overlay of the current
  RNA (as if you had opened the file yourself and checked the box to
  use an overlay).
  <li>If the program that you run generates any other non-empty file with
  the prefix "output" and an extension supported by "Open Text or Image File",
  the file will be opened in the GUI automatically in a separate window
  (as if you had selected "Open Text or Image File").  For example, the file
  "output.txt" or the image "output.png" will be opened for you.
  </ul>

  <br /><br />
  <h2>Automation</h2>
  <p>Programs can also be run from scripts; see <a href="scripting.html"
  >the scripting page</a> for details.
