Feature that are yet to be implemented.

To Do
~~~~~

- Allow the contents of multiple RNA files to be superimposed.
  (When running a separate program, it is necessary to display
  results on top of the original RNA.)

- Allow colors and helix line widths to be configured; perhaps a
  scripting command to set them for future filters.  It should be
  possible to see multiple sets of helices in different colors.
  Also, the default should be customizable (e.g. set to gray).

- Filters should have the option of superimposing results in a
  different color instead of hiding the other helices.  This is
  particularly desirable for visualizing helix energies.

- Highlight (optionally) predicted helices that match actual
  helices displayed in the top-right section.

- Provide a way to organize experiments (e.g. categorized
  directory structure, use date, etc.) so that external programs
  run in a particular place.  Probably, when another program is
  invoked, a new directory should be created and made current so
  that the external program has a designated place to put its
  files.  A naming convention for results files should be agreed
  upon so that the graphical display can update automatically.

- Separate concept of “filter” from “algorithm”, perhaps using
  different top-level menus for running each.

- Add a simultaneous zoomed-out view window when the display is
  zoomed-in.  Use a rectangle to represent the portion that is
  enlarged, and allow the rectangle to be moved with the mouse.

- Investigate a 45-degree-rotated version of the 2D display.

- Investigate ways to make large visuals more practical to
  navigate (split views?).

- Would like to be able to include the extra information from the
  ".alps" file in the display (not just the information that is
  in common with ".bpseq").

- There should be a separate window for statistics, aside from
  the current “Helix Info”.

- Enable selection of multiple helices in certain situations
  (such as, those nearby).

- Enable animation.  Bare minimum would be something like a delay
  mechanism in scripts so that a series of effects could be
  applied at a slow rate.  Another option is the ability to
  export images via scripts and animate the images later.

- Provide a way to display arbitary image and text files so that
  a single interface can show results from other programs.

- Move zoom controls to main display window.

- Allow zoom range to be continuous.

- Provide a way to zoom to “fit” the window.
