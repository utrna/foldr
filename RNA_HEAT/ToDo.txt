Features that are yet to be implemented.

To Do
~~~~~

- Some capabilities can currently only be accessed from the GUI by
  writing scripts in the console, and they may benefit from some
  more dedicated GUI interfaces.  For example, the ability to show
  or hide certain tags, in tandem with file format extensions to
  identify the “most useful” tags in a ".helixcolor" file, may be
  quite helpful.

- There should be more scripting examples, and more documentation
  that is in “tutorial” form versus “reference” form.

- Allow the mini-frame to be clickable; for example, let the user
  click and drag the rectangle to scroll dynamically, or click a
  new area to jump to that location.

- When the mouse is clicked and dragged in the main display, show
  a resizing rectangle and then zoom to the area/magnification
  implied by the rectangular area of interest.

- Enable selection of multiple helices in certain situations
  (such as, those nearby).

- It may be interesting to allow arbitrary X/Y drawings from
  scripts.  (The disadvantage however is that it exposes some
  implementation details that would then be hard to change if
  needed.)

- May need options for E-Loop Filter (to use different
  interpretations of this).

- Interface ideas may be found in RNA2DMap (e.g. using a series
  of checkboxes to enable/disable view options).

- Separate concept of “filter” from “algorithm”, perhaps using
  different top-level menus for running each.

- Add a “bookmarking” scheme to keep track of interesting areas.

- Categorize the Preferences window, e.g. using tabs.

- Investigate a 45-degree-rotated version of the 2D display.

- Investigate ways to make large visuals more practical to
  navigate (split views?).

- Would like to be able to include the extra information from the
  ".alps" file in the display (not just the information that is
  in common with ".bpseq").

- There should be a separate window for statistics, aside from
  the current “Helix Info”.

- Documentation: Explain meaning of Complex/Simple Distance
  defaults; clearly specify E-Loop.

- Add a simultaneous zoomed-out view window when the display is
  zoomed-in.  Use a rectangle to represent the portion that is
  enlarged, and allow the rectangle to be moved with the mouse.

- Provide a way to display arbitary image and text files so that
  a single interface can show results from other programs.

- Allow the contents of multiple RNA files to be superimposed.
  (When running a separate program, it is necessary to display
  results on top of the original RNA.)

- Provide a way to organize experiments (e.g. categorized
  directory structure, use date, etc.) so that external programs
  run in a particular place.  Probably, when another program is
  invoked, a new directory should be created and made current so
  that the external program has a designated place to put its
  files.  A naming convention for results files should be agreed
  upon so that the graphical display can update automatically.

- Move zoom controls to main display window.

- Allow zoom range to be continuous.

- Provide a way to zoom to “fit” the window.
